# Hunting GitHub Secrets Across Time and Space

This repository is an interactive Git tutorial puzzle. A secret flag is hidden in this repoâ€™s history.

**Warning:** All visible flags are redacted as `FLAG{****}`. Your task is to use Git to find the one real flag buried in a past commit on a non-`main` branch.
